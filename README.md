## 📦 Installation

### Using JitPack

Add JitPack to your root `build.gradle`:

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
Add the dependency:

gradle
Copy code
dependencies {
    implementation "com.github.isheunesutembo:ecocash-library:1.0.0"
}
🚀 Getting Started
Initialize the Library
kotlin
Copy code
EcoCash.initialize(
    context = this,
    merchantId = "YOUR_MERCHANT_ID",
    merchantKey = "YOUR_MERCHANT_KEY",
    environment = EcoCashEnvironment.SANDBOX // or EcoCashEnvironment.PRODUCTION
)
Request a Payment
kotlin
Copy code
EcoCash.requestPayment(
    amount = 10.0,
    phoneNumber = "0771234567",
    reference = "ORDER_12345",
    description = "Payment for order #12345",
    callback = object : EcoCashCallback {

        override fun onSuccess(transactionId: String) {
            // Payment successful
        }

        override fun onPending() {
            // Payment pending user confirmation
        }

        override fun onFailure(error: String) {
            // Payment failed
        }
    }
)
🔁 Handling Callbacks
The library handles most of the EcoCash API complexity internally, but you should:

Log all transaction states

Store transaction references in your database

Handle retries for pending transactions
